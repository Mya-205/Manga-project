# Manga-project
This code will ask the user whether they want to know about a manga or a manga artist.
If the user selects "manga" then they got two option- they can either get a description of the manga, or a image of a manga cover. (For example, if the user searched "Attack on titan", the description of the series will come up from wikipedia, or an image of a volume cover will come up.)

If the user selects "author" then information about the author of a manga comes up (For example, searching for Hajime Isayama will come up with what series he created and other information about him too)
